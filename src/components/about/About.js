        <p>
          Young inspiring Front-end developer from Riga. I am a person who likes
          to find a simple solution for complex problems. In addition to that
          illustrating code logic in a simple eye-pleasing manner. Also, I don'
          let challenges/problems discourage me from my goal. As a result of
          experimenting with code, learning something new. Above all, enjoy
          working in a team with whom share ideas and discuss new ways to
          achieve results.
